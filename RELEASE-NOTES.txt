Changed on date: 8/29/16
Description: Changed java in the for loop in closest_edge. Old one was
"for (int i = 0; i < p.size() -1; i++)". Changed this to "for (int i =
0; i < p.size(); i++)"

Description: Changed c++ function
counterclockwise_corner_index. Made the for loop go one step
further. Changed top iteration from p.size()-1 to p.size().

Changed on date: 10/7/16
Description: Changed c++ function recovery_point. Changed last return
statement to return "s" instead of "ans"

Changed on date: 10/17/16
Description: Changed java and c++ version of the function
proj_vect. Changed third if statement from "if (v.Sub(u).det(v.Sub(u))
<= 0) {" to "if (w.Sub(v).det(v.Sub(u)) <= 0) {"

Changed on date: 11/8/16 
Description: Changed java, c++, python, pvs. Changed three functions
in each: near_edge, segments_2D_close, and acceptable_polygon_2D. In
both near_edge and segments_2D_close, added two new test conditions at
the beginning that if are true, the function can immediately return
false. In acceptable_polygon_2D, changed the inner loop to start at i
instead of 0. This doesn't change the output but makes it faster
because it iterates fewer times.

Changed on date: 11/18/16
Description: Changed java, c++, python, pvs. Changed the function
winding_number. It used to return the floor of 0.5 plus the total
number of quandrant changes divided by 4 (floor(total/4+0.5)). Now it
simply returns total/4. This doesn't change the output.
